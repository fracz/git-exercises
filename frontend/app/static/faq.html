<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<h2>What is it and how to use it?</h2>
<p>The <code>exercises</code> repository contains problems that you may encounter in everyday work with Git.
    Each problem resides in its own branch which you can checkout and verify your git-skills.
    In general, all exercises assume that you know basics of Git (i.e. how to commit a file and what the working and
    staging area is).</p>

<p>The <code>README.md</code> file always contains an explanation of the problem and the expected repository state that
    should be achieved. A special git command (alias) <code>git start</code> has been prepared for the purpose of
    preparing your local commit history and working area for the exercise.</p>

<p>In fact, the <code>main</code> branch contains the first exercise.</p>

<h2>How to start?</h2>
<div start-commands></div>

<div ng-include="'home/home-faq.html'"></div>

<h2>How to verify my solution?</h2>
<p>When you think you are ready with the exercise, just execute the <code>git verify</code> command. It will try to
    push your changes to the remote repository and tell you if the provided solution is correct.</p>

<p>There may be situation when the <code>git verify</code> tells you that the exercise name is invalid.
    This means that you have probably changed the branch name during work. In such cases, you need to tell what exercise
    you are currently trying to solve with <code>git verify exercise-name</code> command.</p>

<p>One more thing. You can always simplty <code>git push</code> your solutions. The remote repository will always tell
    you that your changes have been rejected but it will display the solution result anyway. In fact, <code>git
        verify</code>
    does <code>git push</code> and greps-out unnecessary information.</p>

<h2>How to find the next exercise?</h2>
<p>When you pass the exercise successfully, output of <code>git verify</code> command will tell you the next exercise
    name
    as well as the command you need to execute in order to be in the right place (that is <code>git start
        exercise-name</code>).</p>

<p>You can also jump to any of the exercises at any moment. To display list of them, execute the <code>git
    exercises</code>
    command or view the <a ui-sref="exercise">exercises</a> page.</p>

<h2>How to reset exercise and start from the beginning?</h2>
<p>Each time you got lost you can discard all changes you made in an exercise and start from scratch with executing
    <code>git start</code> command without any arguments.

<p>This will work only if you are on an exercise branch. If not, tell git which task you want to start with by executing
    <code>git start exercise-name</code>.</p>

<h2>Which Git version should I use?</h2>
<p>A reasonable one. Nowadays, you should use Git 2.x, but the exercises should work with 1.7.x and above.</p>

<h2>Is it open source?</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/fracz/git-exercises">Of course.</a></p>

<h2>So I can add new exercises?</h2>
