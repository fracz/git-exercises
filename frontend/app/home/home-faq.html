<h2>Why do you need my e-mail?</h2>
<p>Your e-mail address will not be used for anything but identifying your solutions. It doesn't
    have to
    be valid. It will not be stored in any place. Moreover, git will complain if you don't specify one.</p>
<h2>What does <code>./configure.sh</code> do?</h2>
<p>It configures git aliases to facilitate switching between tasks, starting them etc. It does not
    influence your global git configuration. Still in doubt? Go and <a
            href="https://github.com/fracz/git-exercises/blob/master/configure.sh">check it yourself</a>.</p>
<h2>And the <code>git start</code>?</h2>
<p>That is the first <a ui-sref="cheatsheet">alias</a> configured by the script described above. It initializes the
    first exercise that is on <code>master</code> branch. Read the <a ui-sref="exercise">instructions</a>
    and solve it!</p>
