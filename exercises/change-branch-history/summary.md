Although rebase is the easiest way of solving this exercise you may also use a [`git cherry-pick`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-cherry-pick) command:

    git checkout hot-bugfix
    git cherry-pick change-branch-history

This results in the same commit history of the `change-branch-history` branch but the overall result is different than after rebase. 
When cherry-picking, the `hot-bugfix` branch is moved forward and it points to the same commit as `change-branch-history`. 
Be aware of that.

Note that you should not rebase commits when you have published them already.
