# Only commit tracked files 

Frequently, temporary files are created in the work tree: compilation results, automatic backups, logs, etc. Normally, we do not want to commit files that can be recreated from the source code (or those that are unimportant). 

Commit all files that have already been tracked and have been modified without adding any untracked files.
