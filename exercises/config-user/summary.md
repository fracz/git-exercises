The 'git config' command is used to configure the variables used by Git. You can also view (and edit) them directly in the.git/config file of any project. 

To configure a variable in the same way for all your projects, use 'git config --global'. These variables are then stored in '~/.gitconfig'. It's a good idea to globally configure 'user.name' and 'user.email'. 

Now may be a good time to set up your default text editor. Git will frequently open a text editor for you. Choose the one you prefer to use by configuring the 'core.editor' variable
