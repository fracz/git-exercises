#Configuration of Git 
Before making a first commit, we must first fill in our credentials; mainly the name and email that will appear in the commit metadata. 

Type 'git log' for examples. See the 'Author' field? It is thanks to this information that we will be able to know the author of a commit and possibly write to him. 

For this exercise, your name and email have been reset to a default value. Reconfigure it as you entered it the first time (ORIGINAL_NAME). Then check the exercise with 'git verify'. When successful, check that your name appears correctly with 'git log'.
