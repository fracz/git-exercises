[`git add -p`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-add#_interactive_mode) allows you to stage parts of the changes you have made to the file.
It can be helpful if you want to split the work you have done.

Please note that you can also stash, reset or checkout parts of the files, too.
Just add `-p` argument to these commands.
