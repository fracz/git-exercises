## Commit part of work

You are working on an issue for a long time and you noticed you have done too much. You want your work to be committed
in two separate commits instead of one.

Unfortunately, your changes involve only one file so it is impossible to `git add` different files separately.

Commit all new lines that contains "Task 1" phrase in the first commit and the rest of them in the second.
