## Find commits that introduced swearwords
You noticed that your project contains swearwords. You don't want to remove them in the next commit as your boss might
someday find out that they were present in the codebase for a while.

Find all commits that add *shit* word to either `words.txt` or `list.txt` and change them so they introduce 
word *flower* instead.
