## Fix typographic mistake in old commit
While you were working you noticed a typographic error in `file.txt` - you wrote `wordl` instead of `world`.

Unfortunately, you have made another commit on top of the typo so simple `git commit --amend` is not enough.

Fix the typographic error by amending commit in history. Pay attention to the commit message, too!
