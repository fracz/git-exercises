You need to add chosen files to the staging area with [`git add`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-add) command.
Then, you need to commit it with [`git commit`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit). For example:

    git commit -m "Some commit message"
    
If you don't remember it yet, send solution for verification with

    git verify
