## Ignore unwanted files

It is often good idea to tell Git which files it should track and which it should not. Developers almost always do not
want to include generated files, compiled code or libraries into their project history.

Your task is to create and commit configuration that would ignore:

 * all files with `exe` extension
 * all files with `o` extension
 * all files with `jar` extension
 * the whole `libraries` directory
 
Sample files are generated for you.
