git rebase -i HEAD^^
# "squash" or "fixup" the second commit
###
The easiest way to make one commit out of two (or more) is to squash them
with git rebase -i command and choose squash option for all but the first
commit you want to preserve. Note that you can also use fixup command
when you want to discard consequent commit messages and leave only the
first one.

Remember that you don't need to know the commit SHA-1 hashes when specifying
them in git rebase -i command. When you know that you want to go 2 commits
back, you can always run git rebase -i HEAD^^ or git rebase -i HEAD~2.

Note that you should not squash commits when you have published them already.
